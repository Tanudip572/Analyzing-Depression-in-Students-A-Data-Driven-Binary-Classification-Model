# Analyzing-Depression-in-Students-A-Data-Driven-Binary-Classification-Model
This project aims to predict whether an individual is experiencing depression using logistic regression modeling. The dataset underwent preliminary cleaning by removing missing values. Depression, a binary categorical variable, was selected as the response variable. The first step involved ensuring the fundamental assumptions of logistic regression were met. Factor analysis was performed using correlation matrices and ANOVA to verify the independence of explanatory variables, following which highly dependent variables were dropped. Outliers were identified and removed based on Cookâ€™s distance. The event per variable (EPV) ratio was examined to ensure model stability.
Further, linearity between continuous predictors and the logit of the response was assessed using the Box-Tidwell test. A logistic regression model was trained on a training subset and validated on a test subset, with multicollinearity assessed using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). The model's performance was evaluated using confusion matrix-based metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the ROC curve.
To address non-linear relationships, a spline-based logistic regression model was also developed. Both models were compared based on performance metrics to determine the more effective approach. The study provides insights into the predictive modeling of depression, highlighting the importance of satisfying model assumptions and handling non-linearity effectively.
